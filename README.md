This is a simple replacement for in-memory ADODB recordsets. It's reasonably fast and has no external dependencies.
Insert the class code into your VBA project.

The sample code provides a range of examples.

The class supports:
  Fields: **add** (field names and field type), **delete** (including any column data), **count**, **Collection** (returns a collection object containing the fields), **Exists** (returns true if the field name exists)
    efIndex = 6
